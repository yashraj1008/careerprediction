This is a Career based Recommendation System project. Choosing the right career path is often a difficult decision for a student as a student goes through multiple phases like peer pressure, parents’ pressure, etc. during this time. So, to help students in such conditions developed a model that guides the student based on his/her profile and skill ratings. This model extracts unique features from the profile and predicts the best-fit career option and also predicts what career options one should not go for. This will help the student to excel in the field in which he/she is really capable in.
